This is a browser-based version of the classic memory game, "Simon Says." The goal is to follow and repeat a sequence of colors that light up. With each correct response, the sequence lengthens, testing your memory.

Features:
User-friendly Interface: The game displays four large, color-coded buttons (orange, red, blue, and cyan) in a grid. Each button is clickable and corresponds to a different sound and sequence number.
Dynamic Gameplay: The game starts by showing a random sequence of flashing colors. Players must click the buttons in the correct order to proceed.
Score Tracking: Displays both the highest score achieved and the current game score after each game over.
Responsive Restart: After failing to repeat the sequence, players can easily restart by pressing any key.
The game is built using HTML for structure, CSS for design and animations, and JavaScript to manage game logic and interactions. It's an engaging and simple way to challenge your memory and improve concentration.
